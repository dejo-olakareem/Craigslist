Your Personal Story
At LinkedIn, we strive for a culture that embraces and represents diverse ways of thinking, background, and approaches to solving the world’s problems. Tell us about yourself, and what unique point of view, experiences, and background you bring to LinkedIn.

It all started out with an ambition to always be better than myself,everytime I am in a certain environment,I look for what I can do to improve that environment, what can I do to help. This passion led me to travel all the way from Nigeria(west Africa) to the united states where there is lot of oppurtunities. getting to the united State,I did my MBA graduate studies to give me the insight about global business and domestic business. I travelled to Dubai to vist 8 fortune 500 companies to learn how they cope with businesses. While doing this I was working for wells fargo, and my graduate school help me contribute to the development of the company by equiping me with the skill to discuss business with potential customers. It also equipped me with necessary management skills,I was promoted to the Assistant Manager of the head quaters for wells Fargo.

Having to take on more on what to do for this country,I enrolled in the United State Army to give back, currently I am an officer candidate in the Army. This daily reminds me of selfless service to humanity. The army enforced my already leadership and discipline skills in which I use in my time in  management at Wells Fargo. I am always grateful for this.

Programing for me started when I wanted to solve an economic problem I saw and It was going to cost me lot of money to implement that idea.which was creating an App were individuals can lend each other money with a Zero interest rate. I took the oppurtunity to save up for a non traditional bootcamp that will equip me with the neecessary skill and me not having to drown myself in debt. July 2016, I enrolled into Devbootcamp and the journey started with phase 0. I wrote my first hello world! and I can never forget that moment, I still get that chill all the time when I read the phrase Hello!. I passed  Phase 0,a 9 week remote program to teach you foundation of coding and quit my job given my boss a two month notice,I will be immersing myself into this new passion of mine, forgoing not having an income and living in San Francisco,It is a step I have never look back too. Coding everyday,everywere and taking monthly break with my military drill is awesome. At drill I even speak in code terms. Thinking and writing code all the time make harder problem more solvable.
